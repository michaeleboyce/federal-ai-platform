The security features that are found on the presented document then need to be compared against the expected/known security features for the specific document and its issuer.\n\nAdditionally, with the advent of electronic identity documents, the electronic data stored on the document must be authenticated and validated using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) components to cryptographically assess the data encoded in the chip of the document and their binding to the Issuer. Finally, to ensure the document belongs to the individual presenting the document, a biometric match comparing the image from the document to the individual should be made, and the liveness of the individual must be determined - especially in remote vetting situations.",

    "service_description": "Archive360 provides a modern archive and governance platform to address the challenge of a growing number of digital communications channels, legal and regulatory record retention, data privacy and security requirements. Compliantly collecting, retaining, and managing growing volumes of data from multiple channels in a timely manner is increasingly important to department and agency missions, and difficult without the proper tools. Archive360’s platform helps manage data consistent with digital record keeping requirements, such as the Federal Records Act, NARA Records Management Rules, and OMB directives on transition to electronic records.  \nArchive360’s solutions enable adoption of the federal government’s Cloud First mandates, Executive Orders as to cloud optimization, and OMB’s directives including M-23-07.  Archive360’s solutions have been successfully deployed and trusted by public sector agencies globally in the U.S., U.K., Canada, and Australia, including numerous components of U.S. security, civilian intelligence, educational, veterans’ agencies as well as individual US States.\nArchive360’s digital communications governance and archiving solution brings together data from common channels and legacy archives into a petabyte-scale platform that: \n•        Ensures that digital communications are captured, governed, and readily accessible to authorized stakeholders\n•        Provides extensive retention and disposition capabilities supporting government and agency records management requirements\n•        Enables data classification across communication and data channels for granular governance controls\n•        Supports file and data archiving use cases\n•        Provides secure, scalable eDiscovery and FOIA-search capabilities through an intuitive user interface\n•        Provides case management, tagging and annotation capabilities for investigations and review and production of data \n•        Delivers cross-system visibility and control over data processing, retention, disposition and legal holds \n•        Ensures data authenticity and chain of custody with a complete audit trail for actions (system and user) within the platform \n•        Cloud-native platform that provides high-levels of data durability, resiliency, and immutability where required\n•        Zero trust security model, which requires specific entitlement grants to access any data. The platform incorporates an entitlement engine, which allows for granular access controls, including restrictions based on role, class of data, functionality\n•        Encryption of all data in motion and at rest, with the option for agency managed encryption keys\n\nSecurity and scalability are paramount for government departments and agencies to achieve their data governance mission.  Archive360 deploys each agency in a dedicated SaaS environment, deployed to their own tenant. As a result, each department, agency or organizational unit has completely segregated data, administrative access, entitlements, and the ability to integrate into their security protocols. \n\nArchive360 is deployed as a cloud-native, microservices architecture. Archive360 can tailor the deployment to specific mission workloads and requirements. This deployment model mitigates data migration or exit risk at the end of a term, since the tenant can be turned over to the department or agency with the resident data.\n\nThroughout the platform, Archive360 maintains an extensive event audit history, supporting a complete chain of custody. This includes data processing, access, changes to configurations and controls, search, disposition, or export, all at an object level. This provides rapid traceability for audit and response purposes, and defensibility of authorized activities. \nSupported digital communication channels include:\n•        SMTP and Journal Based Email\n•        Microsoft M365 and Exchange\n•        Microsoft Teams\n•        Google Workspace\n•        SMS and Mobile Data\n•        FileShare Data\n•        Legacy Email Archives\n",

    "service_description": "Armis, FedRAMP Edition (AFE) is an agentless, enterprise-class security platform purpose-built to help organizations discover and secure managed, unmanaged, and IoT devices, including medical devices and industrial control systems (ICS). Armis discovers every managed, unmanaged, and IoT device in any environment, analyzes device behavior to identify risks, vulnerabilities or attacks, and protects critical business information and systems. Armis easily integrates with existing security products. AFE passively monitors wired and wireless traffic in the environment to identify every device and to understand its behavior without disruption. AFE analyzes this data in the AFE Risk Engine which uses device profiles and characteristics from the AFE Device Knowledgebase to identify each device, assess its risks & vulnerabilities, detect threats, and recommend remediation actions.\n\nVisibility:\nAFE closes the Continuous Diagnostic and Mitigation Dashboard visibility gap with unmanaged and IoT devices. AFE discovers and classifies every managed, unmanaged, and IoT device in the environment including servers, laptops, smartphones, VoIP phones, smart TVs, IP cameras, printers, 5G, HVAC controls, medical devices, industrial controls, and more. AFE can even identify off-network devices using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other protocols in any environment. The comprehensive device inventory that AFE generates includes critical information such as device manufacturer, model, serial number, location, username, operating system, installed applications, and connections made over time. In addition to discovering and classifying a device, AFE calculates its risk score based on factors such as vulnerabilities, known attack patterns, as well as the behaviors observed of each device in the environment. This risk score helps security teams understand their attack surface and meet compliance with regulatory frameworks that require identification and prioritization of vulnerabilities.\n\nInsights:\nThe AFE Risk Engine continuously monitors the behavior of every device in the environment for behavioral anomalies. Working with the AFE Device Knowledgebase, AFE compares the real-time behavior of each device with:\n- Historical device behavior\n- Behavior of similar devices in the Customer's environment\n- Behavior of similar devices in other environments\n- Common attack techniques\n- Information from threat intelligence feeds\n\nActions:\nWith these types of critical device and behavioral insights, AFE is able to identify threats and attacks. When AFE detects a threat, it can alert security teams and trigger automated action to stop an attack. Through integrations with network infrastructure, as well as the Customer's existing security enforcement points like Cisco and Palo Alto Networks firewalls, and network access control (NAC) products such as Cisco ISE and Aruba ClearPass, AFE can restrict access or quarantine suspicious or malicious devices.\n\nEasy Integration:\nAFE requires no agents or additional hardware to deploy. AFE integrates with existing firewalls or NAC, security management systems such as SIEM, ticketing systems, and asset databases. These integrations allow AFE to leverage existing investments to achieve greater value and more automated response.",

All vetted and monitored through the rigorous FedRAMP authorization process.  Use it to connect data centers, branches, campuses, and colocation facilities to improve network speed, security, and efficiency. Cisco Catalyst SDWAN-G is a cloud-delivered overlay WAN architecture connecting branches to data centers and multi-cloud environments through a single fabric and single pane of glass. Cisco Catalyst SDWAN-G helps ensure a predictable user experience for applications optimized for SaaS, IaaS, and PaaS connections. Comprehensive on-premises and cloud-based security protect against cyberthreats while enabling IT teams to accelerate the transition to a Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) architecture where and when it is needed.\n \nCisco Catalyst SD-WAN Government (SDWAN-G) is owned, operated, and supported directly by Cisco for use in government offerings, providing the following capabilities:\n \n - Enhanced Visibility: Extend your network visibility and observability with our core government self-service portal. You'll gain actionable insights to help you transform network operations from reactive to highly proactive model.\n \n - Right Security, Right Place: On-premises or cloud-based security with secure SDWAN-G helps to accelerate the transition to a secure access service edge (SASE) architecture where and when it's needed.\n \n - Operational Simplicity: With a highly visualized interface and intuitive user experience for simplified configuration, management, operation, and monitoring across the Cisco Catalyst SDWAN-G fabric.

Guided step-by-step configuration designed to intelligently expedite onboarding of new devices, and full integration of unified communication, and security into Cisco Catalyst SDWAN-G.\n  \nThe Cisco Catalyst SDWAN-G solution is segregated into four planes with four key components: \n \nManager\n \n- In the management plane, the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager is the centralized network management system and represents the user interface of the solution. Network administrators and operators can configure, provision, troubleshoot, and manage the entire overlay network from a simple graphical dashboard.\n \nValidator\n \n- In the orchestration plane, the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Validator automatically orchestrates connectivity between edge devices and Controllers. The Validator is largely responsible for the provisioning process as well as first-line authentication, control/management information distribution, and facilitating Network Address Translation (NAT) traversal.\n \nController\n \n- In the control plane, the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Controller is the component responsible for enforcing policies centrally. When branches come online, their routing information is exchanged with the Controller and not directly with other branches. The Controller works with the Validator to authenticate edge devices as they join the network and to orchestrate connectivity among the edge devices.\n  \nEdge Devices\n \n- In the data plane, the Edge devices are responsible for establishing the network fabric and handle the transmission of data traffic. Edge devices come in multiple forms, virtual and physical, and are selected based on the connectivity, throughput, and functional needs of the site. The operating system of the Edge devices is securely developed and tested as part of Cisco’s Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) prior to releasing a version for the customer to deploy. In-boundary scanning of the operating system deployed with Edge devices for Cisco Catalyst SDWAN-G are scanned as part of Cisco’s continuous monitoring strategy.\n\nCollectively, the architecture of the Cisco Catalyst SDWAN-G fabric simplifies IT operations with automated provisioning, unified policies, streamlined management to help ensure rapid updates and resolutions, advanced network functionality, resiliency, and security. From a single pane of glass, Cisco Catalyst SDWAN-G helps organizations avoid complex configurations and frequent policy changes that lead to uneven user experiences, thereby increasing overall network efficiency and reliability.",

With Cloudera for Government, users can create and manage secure data lakes, self-service analytics, and machine learning services without installing and managing the data platform software. Cloudera for Government services are managed by Cloudera, but the customer’s data remains under their control in their AWS cloud account.\n\nCloudera for Government lets customers:\n•        Control cloud costs by automatically spinning up workloads when needed, scaling them as the load changes over time and suspending their operation when complete.\n•        Isolate and control workloads based on user type, workload type, and workload priority.\n•        Combat proliferating silos and centrally control customer and operational data across multi-cloud and hybrid environments.\n\nCloudera for Government contains several layers of infrastructure, operations software, networks, and the CDP services. The two primary components of the solution are the CDP Control Plane and the Customer Workload Environment.\nThe CDP Control Plane provides a set of core services that perform several functions across the platform. Control Plane services are implemented in a microservice architecture running on Kubernetes. These services can be configured and scaled independently based on their function. Each service performs a specialized function, and services can also communicate with other services within the Control Plane. Each set of microservices that performs a specific function is isolated from other sets of microservices. This segregation permits each set of microservices to have its own identity, allowing for differentiation of access between system components.  \n\nThe Workload Environment is a cloud account that has been associated with a customer tenant inside the Control Plane. A tenant is a group of users that share access to a specific set of resources and a billing relationship with Cloudera. In general, each Cloudera for Government customer is a single tenant, but large organizations may have multiple tenants. When a CDP service, such as a data lake, gets created, it gets created within a Workload Environment. The customer Workload Environment is separate from the Control Plane and resides within the customer’s AWS account outside the system authorization boundary.\n",

    "service_description": "System Functionality: SFS is a zero-trust data security, sharing, and collaboration web platform that uses Cocoon Data-patented technology called Secure Objects to apply the principles of least privilege to the document level. SFS is a system similar to services such as Google Drive or Box. It enables the customer to securely share files and collaborate on them within the SFS web app. The difference is in how SFS implements encryption and the concept of zero-trust security with these files by encapsulating them in Cocoon Data-patented technology called Secure Objects. Each file has a unique encryption key tied to identity and access controls attributes such as clearance and classification.\n\nThe SFS SaaS solution allows customers to securely store, share, and control access to encrypted files and folders within the customer’s organization, outside the authorization boundary, and from mobile devices through a self-contained unit called an “organization.” An organization (deployed customer tenant) is self-contained, meaning that the sharing and manipulation of content is handled solely within the scope of the organization itself; therefore, any SFS user’s ownership of content (including permissions to access the customer’s content/data) is specific to each organization.\n\nThrough the implementation of Secure Objects, the identity of the user is validated through the identity provider (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol [LDAP], Personal Identity Verification [PIV], etc.) that ties the identity of the data owner to its associated encryption keys. Secure Objects must be associated with a key (for encryption) and an originator (data owner). Customers have the option to designate collaborators, metadata, and apply extensive access controls to their data.\n\n\nSFS is available to customers with two options for tenancy:\nCustomers may use the shared tenancy option where they receive their own Organization within the SFS application. This option logically separates customers within the SFS application but each file is encrypted using Cocoon Data’s proprietary Secure Objects technology and the Cocoon Data Content Crypto Service cryptographic module (CMVP%23 4307). \nCustomers may opt for the private tenancy option where they receive their own instances of the SFS Application. The customer would have their own custom URL for logging into the system and their own dedicated infrastructure. This option allows the customer to set up multiple Organizations as they see fit to further control which of their users can access what files they’ve uploaded to SFS.\nThe private tenancy option is the recommended option for Federal Agencies as it offers the strongest separation measures from other customers.\n\n\nThe services/functions provided to the customer by SFS are delivered via containerized services. Containerization is used across multiple availability zones for redundancy. The containers that run the service are the Content Service, Access Service, GeoFence Service, Notification Service, Web Service, Office Server Service, API Server, etcd, Controller and Scheduler.\n\nContent Service\nThe Content Service contains the FIPS validated Cocoon Data Content Crypto Service (Certificate %234307). This service is responsible for handling the encryption keys, content encryption, version control, integrity checks and overall management of the data.\n\n\nAccess Service \nThe Access Service  contains the Cocoon Data Access Service. This service is responsible for the access control to the Cocoon Data system, internal authentication, external LDAP authorizations, and SAML 2.0 authentications. It is also responsible for determining if a user has access to files or not based on a multitude of factors including but not limited to; clearances and classification, geographic location of the user and geofencing, user security roles, and security permissions. The scope of access to documents can also be further restricted so that users with access will only be able to perform specific actions on the file. An example would be giving a user view, but not download permissions.\n",

Thousands of the world's largest organizations in both public and private sector rely on PhishMe to condition employees to recognize and report phishing attacks. \n\nPhishMe enables trained awareness and compliance personnel to run simulated attacks using email templates that look like actual phishing attacks and includes on-the-spot educational content that displays when recipients click on one of the simulated phishing emails. For example, a scenario email might alert recipients that their (e.g. banking) credentials were compromised and ask the recipients to click a link in the email to reset their password. If a recipient does click the link, PhishMe displays educational content to help that individual recognize the characteristics of a phishing email. Through these safe examples, PhishMe customers can help their employees develop an awareness of the risks that real phishing emails pose and reduce their susceptibility of engaging with such emails in the future. \n\nTo maximize the effectiveness of simulation campaigns and reduce the burden on awareness teams, Cofense PhishMe provides a combination of unique capabilities:\n\n- Content is based on real phishing attacks gleaned from real threat intelligence. That means that the scenarios you run are as realistic as possible, ensuring your organization is conditioned to the latest threats.\n\n- Responsive Delivery allows simulation operators to deliver phishing simulations while the user is active in their inbox, which drives higher scenario engagement. \n\n- Predefined playbooks with scenario recommendations based on user behavior and best practices. \n\n- PhishMe helps organizations transform their employees into the last line of active defense against phishing attacks - the leading cause of data breaches - through education, ongoing simulations, and an easy to use reporting tool, Cofense Reporter, so organizations can swiftly detect, respond to and thwart phishing attacks in their tracks.",

    "service_description": "With CyberArk Endpoint Privilege Manager government organizations can confidently defend against attacks by automatically removing local admin rights, enforcing least privilege, enabling policy-based comprehensive conditional application control, maintaining application catalog, and protecting the entire endpoint security stack from tampering – in line with a number of recent CISA alerts, advisories and recommendations, and starting day one. \n \nThe EPM Secure and flexible SaaS management console allows for centralized policy-based and role-based management to ensure automated, robust and differentiated application of policies based on the user’s role. Automatic elevation of known good programs requiring elevation, including those legacy and not-UAC-aware, significantly cuts down on the IT Service Desk requests, while optional automatic access restriction (for example, network connectivity restriction) for unknown applications significantly reduces the area of attack and helps break ransomware kill chain.  \n \nOut-of-the-box anti-ransomware policy allows to add additional layer of security around sensitive data and prevent data corruption even in the event of successful asset compromise and ransomware execution.  \n \nAdditional critical capabilities include blocking credentials, private keys, secrets, passwords, hashes, cookies and other sensitive information from memory, browsers, operating system and credential stores, effectively blocking most attacks based on credential compromise.  \n \nEndpoint Privilege Manager helps with audit and compliance by addressing specific regulation requirements and creating audit trail for identity and privilege events on the endpoints. \n \nThe following customer side components are authorized as part of the CyberArk EPM for Government offering: EPM Windows Agent, EPM MacOS Agent, EPM Linux Agent.",

Agency HR administrators can review and approve or reject changes to positions, hiring requests, and work unit modifications in accordance with agency protocols and objectives. \n\nFedLens (fedlens.com) is a research-based tool designed to enhance data-driven workforce management and planning through automated reports, trend analysis, and predictive analytics. It comprises three modules: Diagnostics, Snapshots, and Predictions.\n\nFedLens Diagnostics leverages current workforce data to identify risks in areas such as capacity, diversity, skills, performance, and workforce engagement. This data is benchmarked against standards from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and other agencies to assess organizational health.\n\nFedLens Snapshots automates the generation of HR reports commonly required by leadership, offering detailed insights into the onboard workforce.\n\nFedLens Predictions aids agencies in proactive preparation and planning.\n\nFedViews (fedviews.com) is an automated tool for Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) reporting, trend analysis, and workforce planning. It assists federal agencies in generating FEVS reports in compliance with Office of Personnel Management (OPM) requirements. FedViews enables federal HR leaders to compare viewpoint data over time, identify trends, and benchmark scores across departments and within agencies.

    "service_description": "Hypori’s approach to mobile security is analogous to Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI), a term coined by VMware and pioneered by Citrix describing a virtualization technology that hosts a desktop operating system on a centralized server in a data center that is accessed by thin clients on the user’s end point. Hypori Halo creates a Zero Trust architecture to provide secure access to Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and customer data and resources. In the Hypori Halo environment, the user’s device effectively becomes a “window” into a virtualized mobile workspace that is Version 1.1 20 Proprietary and Confidential operating in the Amazon GovCloud and delivered via a Software as a Service (SaaS) model. Hypori Halo uses a thin client application to create a virtual image of the user’s unique virtual mobile workspace. The client captures touch and sensor data from the end user physical device and routes it back to the Virtual Workspace through a secure and encrypted TLS tunnel. The Hypori Client has been tested by multiple Red Teams to ensure it meets the most rigorous security posture. It is Common Criteria Certified by the National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) for Android, iOS, and Windows platforms. NIAP ensures that all certified products “demonstrate exact compliance to the applicable technology protection profile.” This certification verifies that the “Hypori Client is a thin client that communicates only with a Hypori Virtual Workspace on a Hypori Server and not with other servers or applications.” It validates the cryptographic elements of communication with the Hypori environment, that no data is at rest on the user device and no PII is transmitted or stored on the physical end user device. Additionally, the Hypori Client does not trust the mobile device host. It uses application shielding and cryptographic key protection capabilities to defend against compromised hosts. It also has limited runtime OS attestation checks before it will launch. If it detects tampering of the client components, it will not connect to the environment. The data on the client is limited to the trust key chain. The mutual Transport Layer Security (TLS) tunnel certificate is stored with the operating system (OS) protected key store on the device, but no other data is on the end user mobile device. The backend environment consists of a series of subnets which form a cluster. Each cluster is designed to support numerous virtual workspace instances. To the user, the experience is virtually identical to when the application and data was on the user’s mobile device. Private keys within the Virtual Workspace are protected using the Android keystore in combination with the Cloud Service Provider key protection system. The Private keys are encrypted in accordance with Hypori’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2.",

They are improving their DevSecOps processes, facilitating Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), and shipping more code safer than ever. LaunchDarkly enables: \n\n- Resolution of incidents in less than 200 milliseconds, without costly rollbacks that threaten other features.\n- Powerful targeting capabilities that provide complete control over which users or microservices can see new features.\n- Safe testing in production—empowering teams with real-world QA testing in place of costly pre-production environments.\n- CI/CD development processes that improve developer productivity and new feature release times.\n- Hypothesis driven development, including experimentation and percentage rollouts. \n\nLaunchDarkly provides developers and business stakeholders with a central location to manage the rollout of new features. At the same time, it can enforce change management policies through scheduling, approval workflows, and custom role-based access control down to the feature level. Agencies can implement their own policies around the use of personally identifiable information (PII) and can take full advantage of targeting without needing to store user PII within the LaunchDarkly Federal SaaS environment.

The Menlo Secure Enterprise Browser solution prevents attacks while being invisible to end users who can use their preferred web browser, enhancing productivity. Deploy browser security policies in a single click, securing internet access and protecting organizational data down to the last mile.\n\nMenlo Secure Enterprise Browser Solution\nInstantiated for each browser session, the Menlo Secure Cloud Browser secures access to the web, preventing malware, ransomware, and unauthorized access and ensures that data security policies are enforced to prevent malicious or unintentional data theft with multiple Data Loss Prevention (DLP) features. Defending against highly evasive adaptive threats (HEAT), Menlo leverages machine learning and AI-based URL analysis to identify and block the most sophisticated phishing sites. Menlo remote browser isolation (RBI) offers significant performance enhancements in comparison to all other RBI offerings with patented Adaptive Clientless Rendering (ACR). ACR enables web page rendering, including interactive animations such as scrolling, to be performed on the endpoint browser using optimized desktop hardware and browser software, while the full browser feature set—including copy-paste, find in page, and printing—is maintained.\n\nThe administrative policy defines whether any site is isolated. Isolation may be managed with traditional categories which should be familiar and easy to use by administrators of Secure Web Gateways (SWG). Unlike a SWG, however, Menlo enables isolation by threat types and/or vulnerable web services.\n\nMitigating the security blindspot posted by mandated transport level encryption (TLS), Menlo Browsing Forensics offers policy-based capture of browsing sessions. Captures are stored in customer data stores, not accessible to Menlo Security. The Browsing Forensics Viewer enables the Security Operations Center (SOC), incident response, and even security awareness training teams to review users’ sessions including clicks, scrolls and text inputs. Policy controls manage whether password entries are retained, whether a user is notified of recording and screen capture rates.\n\nFiles and archives are delivered with browser protocols. The Menlo Secure Cloud Browser includes comprehensive file and archive inspection. Archives are opened, and each file is subject to hash checks and anti-virus examinations. The safe content of both clean and infected files can be presented as a safe PDF to the user. Policy governs whether any original file or archive may be downloaded from the Secure Cloud Browser. File security checks can be selectively bypassed.\n\nTraffic steering to the Menlo Cloud supports proxy chaining from, for example, existing SWG or Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASB), as well as PAC file deployment or firewall redirecting. Menlo Browser Security is fully compatible with Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) and Security Service Edge (SSE) deployments.\n\nCommon use cases for Menlo Browser Security include: comprehensive zero-hour phishing prevention, ransomware prevention, administrative governance of Generative AI, and comprehensive governance of SaaS using workflows similar to CASB, but including SaaS property isolation and comprehensive file upload and download controls applicable on a per-application basis.",

    "service_description": "The Mimic platform delivers a high-assurance ransomware resilience layer that operates at runtime to stop damage and maintain operational continuity. Built for speed, deception, and recovery, Mimic protects critical applications before ransomware can encrypt or exfiltrate data. Unlike traditional tools, Mimic deploys in the kernel, enabling rapid deflection, application immutability, and lifeboat-based recovery. The platform includes the following core components:\n\nAutomated Deflection and Runtime Resilience\nEarly and Deterministic Response: Mimic continuously monitors application behavior at the kernel level across Windows and Linux systems. At the first sign of ransomware or unauthorized change, protection is triggered in real time—without reliance on manual SOC involvement.\n\nAutomated Deflection Measures: Mimic acts faster than ransomware can execute, deploying the following capabilities automatically:\nApplication Immutability: Critical applications are instantly locked into a protected state, preventing any changes from being made. This protects both against malicious encryption and violations of internal change policies.\nAI-Driven Deception: When an attack is detected, Mimic fabricates decoy data that mirrors real applications and critical assets. These AI-generated lures convince attackers they have succeeded—slowing them down and buying time for response and forensics.\nAdversary Containment: By operating inside the application’s runtime environment, Mimic halts ransomware progression deterministically, even in cases of zero-days or evasive techniques.\n\nRecovery Through the Lifeboat Approach\nIsolated Recovery in Minutes: Mimic’s recovery workflows leverage the Lifeboat—an isolated, clean environment where compromised applications are relaunched safely. This ensures continued operation while the primary environment is investigated and remediated.\nResilient Recovery Process: The platform enables a secure and controlled recovery that includes:\nSpinning up trusted application instances in a separate environment,\nEnforcing authentication controls to prevent attacker reentry, and\nReintegrating recovered systems in a compliant, structured manner.\n\nTesting and Assurance Tools\nContinuous Validation with Customers: Mimic supports ongoing evaluation of its controls in collaboration with the customer’s security team through built-in testing features.\nArena: A secure sandbox that mirrors production environments, enabling customers to simulate attacks and observe platform behavior in controlled conditions.\nSignal Generator: A ransomware simulation engine that replicates real-world adversary tactics—allowing validation of deflection and recovery mechanisms without risking operational harm.\n\nBy integrating ultra-fast response, deception-based defense, and secure recovery, the Mimic platform delivers a last line of defense against ransomware. These automated controls are designed to support internal security frameworks and compliance with standards such as GDPR, SOC 2, FedRAMP, and IL 4—ensuring that even when ransomware breaches initial defenses, operations continue without compromise.",

With Pexip Government Cloud, employees can join Microsoft Teams calls from their existing standards-based meeting room video systems as well as enterprise-class standards-based soft clients.\n•        Bi-Directional SIP Dialing for Windows-Based Microsoft Teams Rooms (MTRw) – Expanding on Pexip’s CVI capability, this feature enables SIP-based video conferencing endpoints to call directly into Microsoft Teams Rooms (MTR) running on Windows, and vice versa. This allows government agencies to integrate MTRw into their broader VTC ecosystem, ensuring seamless cross-platform collaboration. \n•        Google Meet Interoperability – Enables agencies to seamlessly connect standards-based VTC systems directly into Google Meet meetings using native SIP dialing. This allows government users to leverage existing room-based video conferencing hardware to join Google Meet sessions without additional plugins or workarounds, ensuring a secure, seamless, and familiar meeting experience.\n•        Standards-Based Virtual Meeting Rooms (VMRs) – Supports customer VTC endpoint devices and clients, featuring Pexip’s native CMVP-validated FIPS 140-3 encryption suite, ensuring secure and compliant video communications.\n•        Self-Hosted Platform Integration – Enables hybrid VTC deployments where Pexip Government Cloud extends the customer’s existing self-hosted platform. This integration allows VTC systems to seamlessly connect with enterprise third-party applications, support calendaring integrations for simplified end-user join flows, and align with global policy frameworks such as Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) and Secure Access Service Edge (SASE).\n",

    "cloud_service_provider": "Project Hosts Inc.",
    "cloud_service_offering": "GSS One - Azure",
    "service_description": "GSS One-Azure (GSS1-AZ) is delivered as a hybrid offering using a multi-tenant PaaS cloud computing environment. It is available to both private and multitenant customers deployed per the agencies preference and agreements and can be utilized by the following audiences: the public, federal, DoD, state, local, and tribal governments, as well as research institutions, federal contractors, government contractors etc.)].\n\n \n\nThe Project Hosts “GSS1-AZ” PaaS is a Government Only General Support System (GSS) deployed on Azure Government. GSS1-AZ is composed of systems and services that manage access control, authentication, auditing, monitoring, scanning, patching, configuration management, malware prevention, intrusion prevention, incident response, backup, and disaster recovery for each application leveraging the GSS1-AZ. All of the systems that make up the GSS1-AZ and the Project Hosts engineers that administer the systems can be leveraged by any customers to meet the security requirements for their systems.\n\n \n\nThere are three main SaaS components customers deployed on the GSS One-Azure system can leverage:\n\n- GSS One Portal/Admin Page: The GSS One Portal is a page where customer users and PH support can login to create and manage non privileged users for their organization including revoking access. It also provides them with the ability to upload software binaries to the test environment and screenshots and other supporting artifacts required for support tickets. The GSS One Admin page is accessible only to PH engineers and is used for managing inventory, privileged user maintenance windows and account creation and JIT access and has dashboards for PH engineers to provide a centralized view of each environment. \n\n- GSS One Console: GSS One- Console is a one stop shop for agency and CSP customers to view relevant information for their system and aid in implementing and maintaining ConMon requirements including a document repo for SSP and appendixes, POA&Ms and vulnerability scans, allows them to manage training, track incidents, track vulnerabilities and other corrective actions, track red teaming activities, view availability monitoring alerts, change control ticketing, link controls to artifacts and evidence to speed up ATO times, centralized up to date contact lists.\n\n- GSS One Ticketing System:  Project Hosts has configured a customer-facing support portal for creating and managing support tickets. This allows customers to view all of their relevant tickets, create tickets, upload screenshots and communicate with PH staff through a secure channel.\n\n \n\nThere are two main types of customers who use the GSS1-AZ: (i) Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) deploying multitenant SaaS applications and (ii) Federal, state, or local agencies deploying dedicated applications just for their agency or organization (not multitenant). For both types of customers, their applications are deployed on customer-dedicated virtual servers (or FedRAMP-authorized Azure PaaS services) inside customer-dedicated subnets. Network Security Group firewall access controls ensure that each customer's systems are completely isolated from and has no access to any other customer's subnet.\n\n \n\nFor GSS1-AZ customers, Project Hosts also provides services that are over and above the PaaS offering described in the GSS1-AZ FedRAMP package. Namely, Project Hosts deploys, secures, manages, and provides continuous monitoring for applications that are compatible with the GSS1-AZ architecture, authentication, operating system, database, and access requirements.\n\n \n\nMany CSPs do not have the staff or knowledge to fully deploy a cloud workload, write security documentation, refactor the application to meet compliance requirements and work with agencies and the PMO to obtain a FedRAMP authorization which leads to wasted time, money, and resources both for government sponsors and the ISVs. Project Hosts works with these software vendors and agencies to quickly deploy the application to the cloud and build out and manage the system for the customers which includes acting as the security and compliance team for the application. In addition, Project Hosts works with these software vendors to document security controls, perform compliance reviews, perform disaster recovery, and advises the ISV on how refactor the application to meet FedRAMP requirements. Project Hosts security compliance team also performs monthly vulnerability scanning include ACAS scans, dynamic web app scans and container image scans and documents and tracks these findings in accordance with continuous monitoring requirements. Among other things the Project Hosts team also performs (for each customer deployed within the GSS1-AZ) monthly baseline compliance scanning, configuration management, patch and vulnerability management, malware prevention and intrusion prevention using HBSS software, incident response reporting, analysis, eradication, and recovery as well as all SOC review and analysis of audit logs and responding/investigating alerts for suspicious activity. Project Hosts deploys systems to monitor workloads for availability and performance issues and proactively take action to ensure maximum uptime and availability. Performing these functions on the ISVs’ behalf allows the software vendors to focus on their core business model in delivering a secure, highly functional application to the agency.\n\n \n\nFor CSP customers, Project Hosts also creates their SaaS-level FedRAMP package, helps them throughout the agency authorization process, and manages their 3PAO annual assessments.\n\nFor agency customers, Project Hosts assists them in the creation of their own SSP, manages annual 3PAO scanning and penetration testing of their dedicated applications, and provides a monthly application-level POA&M.

    "cloud_service_offering": "GSS One - AWS",
    "service_description": "The Project Hosts “GSS One-AWS” PaaS is a Government Only general support system deployed on AWS GovCloud. The GSS One-AWS is composed of systems and services that manage access control, authentication, auditing, monitoring, scanning, patching, configuration management, malware prevention, intrusion prevention, incident response, backup, and disaster recovery for each Application deployed on the GSS One-AWS.  All of the systems that make up the GSS1-AWS and the Project Hosts engineers that administer the systems can be leveraged by any customers to meet the security requirements for their systems at FedRAMP High or Il4 Impact levels.\n\nThere are three main SaaS components customers deployed on the GSS One-AWS system can leverage and are provided by default:\n\n- GSS One Portal/Admin Page: The GSS One Portal is a page where customer users and PH support can login to create and manage non privileged users for their organization including revoking access. It also provides them with the ability to upload software binaries to the test environment and screenshots and other supporting artifacts required for support tickets. The GSS One Admin page is accessible only to PH engineers and is used for managing inventory, privileged user maintenance windows and account creation and JIT access and has dashboards for PH engineers to provide a centralized view of each environment.\n\n- GSS One Ticketing System:  Project Hosts has configured a customer facing support portal for creating and managing support tickets. This allows customers to view all of their relevant tickets, create tickets, upload screenshots and communicate with PH staff through a secure channel.\n\n- GSS One Console: GSS One Console is a one stop shop for agency and CSP customers to view relevant information for their system and aid in implementing and maintaining ConMon requirements including a document repo for SSP and appendixes, POA&Ms and vulnerability scans, allows them to manage training, track incidents, track vulnerabilities and other corrective actions, track red teaming activities, view availability monitoring alerts, change control ticketing, link controls to artifacts and evidence to speed up ATO times, centralized up to date contact lists.\n\nThere are two main types of customers who use the GSS One-AWS: (i) Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) deploying multitenant SaaS applications and (ii) Federal, state or local agencies deploying dedicated applications just for their agency or organization (not multitenant). \n\nFor both types of customers, their applications are deployed on customer-dedicated virtual servers (or FedRAMP authorized AWS PaaS services) inside customer-dedicated subnets.  VPC Firewall access controls ensure that each customer's subnet is completely isolated from and has no access to any other customer's subnet. \n\nFor GSS One-AWS customers, Project Hosts also provides services that are over and above the PaaS offering described in the GSS One- AWS FedRAMP package and are provided by Project Hosts as a managed service provider for those workloads leveraging the FedRAMP authorized GSS1-AWS tools and services to provide that functionality. Namely, Project Hosts deploys, secures, manages, and provides continuous monitoring for applications that are compatible with the GSS One-AWS architecture, authentication, operating system, database, and access requirements.\n\nMany ISVs do not have the staff or knowledge to fully deploy a cloud workload, write security documentation, refactor the application to meet compliance requirements and work with agencies and the PMO to obtain a FedRAMP authorization which leads to wasted time, money, and resources both for government sponsors and the ISVs. Project Hosts works with these software vendors and agencies to quickly deploy the application to the cloud and build out and manage the system for the customers which includes acting as the security and compliance team for the application. In addition, Project Hosts works with these software vendors to document security controls, perform compliance reviews, perform disaster recovery, and advises the ISV on how refactor the application to meet FedRAMP requirements.\n\nProject Hosts security compliance team also performs monthly vulnerability scanning include ACAS scans, dynamic web app scans and container image scans and documents and tracks these findings in accordance with continuous monitoring requirements. Among other things the Project Hosts team also performs (for each customer deployed within the GSS1-AWS) monthly baseline compliance scanning, configuration management, patch and vulnerability management, malware prevention and intrusion prevention using HBSS software, incident response reporting, analysis, eradication, and recovery as well as all SOC review and analysis of audit logs and responding/investigating alerts for suspicious activity.\n\nProject Hosts deploys systems to monitor workloads for availability and performance issues and proactively take action to ensure maximum uptime and availability. Performing these functions on the ISVs’ behalf allows the software vendors to focus on their core business model in delivering a secure, highly functional application to the agency.\n\nFor ISV customers, Project Hosts also creates their SaaS-level FedRAMP or DoD package, helps them throughout the agency authorization process, and manages their 3PAO annual assessments.\n\nFor agency customers or DoD Mission partners, Project Hosts assists them in the creation of their own SSP, manages annual 3PAO scanning and penetration testing of their dedicated applications, and provides a monthly application-level POA&M.  Following is a partial list of applications for which Project Hosts is providing these services over and above the GSS One-AWS platform:\n\n- San Luis Aviation, Inc. (ESChat)\n- FutureFeed (FutureFeed)\n- H20.ai (H20 AI Cloud)\n- JAMIS (JAMIS Prime)\n- Telcloud (Telcloud)\n- Caveonix (Caveonix SaaS Platform)\nIf an agency would like to use one of these Applications or bring in another GSS One-AWS compatible Application, Project Hosts will provide application-level artifacts that will help the agency or mission partner assess the risk of deploying that application in the GSS1-AWS as well as any other documentation or evidence required in order to grant an Authority to Operate (ATO).\n\n ",

Its web interface offers fully secure email archiving with robust search and discovery, supervision, and enforcement features. The solution securely stores electronic messages for a specified retention period, while keeping the messages fully searchable and retrievable in real-time or with a batch process. This allows archived messages to be easily viewed, retrieved to a user's email inbox or exported to an Outlook data file.\n\nThe Archiving Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) is software-based, a hardware-based version is also available, and is installed within the Microsoft Office 365 ITAR environment behind the firewall to provide the tight integration and security typically only afforded to internal systems. The CPE integrates with Microsoft Exchange to ensure reliable, native format message archiving. Its integration with Active Directory facilitates unified login and access control management. Since the CPE is the only holder of the encryption keys used with Proofpoint's DoubleBlind™ Encryption technology, any processing that involves encryption or decryption happens on the CPE.\n\nProofpoint's DoubleBlind™ Encryption technology guarantees the security of data, ensuring that no one outside the organization can access archived data. When a message reaches the CPE, it is encrypted before being sent outside the Microsoft Office 365 ITAR firewall over a secure connection to the Proofpoint Federal Production Environment. Messages are only decrypted when an authorized user on the customer network conducts a search from Outlook or from the CPE's web-based user interface. Data can never be viewed without access to both the archiving CPE within the Microsoft Office 365 ITAR environment and the Proofpoint Federal Production Environment.",

It is available to financial institutions and fintech companies, federal, state, local, and tribal governments, as well as research institutions, federal contractors, and government contractors.\n\nSentiLink Corp. is a software-as-a-service financial technology company headquartered in San Francisco, California. It provides fraud detection and prevention services to financial institutions in the\nUnited States.\nSynthetic Fraud Scores\nSentiLink’s Synthetic Fraud Scores solution helps entities stop hard-to-detect synthetic identities in real-time.\n\nThe Synthetic Fraud Scores product scores applications from 0 (low risk) to 999 (high risk). Three scores are provided on every identity: a composite score, a first-party synthetic score, and a third-party synthetic score. These scores are defined as follows:\nFirst-party synthetic score: the likelihood that the identity is first-party synthetic fraud\nThird-party synthetic score: the likelihood that the identity is third-party synthetic fraud\nAbuse score: the likelihood that the identity is associated with synthetic fraud or other related fraud risks\nID Theft Scores\nSentiLink’s ID Theft Scores solution determines the likelihood that someone is using stolen credentials to open an account. The solution provides a score between 0 and 999. The higher the score, the higher the likelihood of ID theft. ID Theft Scores are provided via an application programming interface (API) or a user dashboard, and a single API call can be used for both ID Theft Scores and Synthetic Fraud Scores.\nFirst-Party Fraud Flags\nThe First-Party Fraud Flags solution allows customers to determine whether an applicant possesses characteristics indicative of identity-related fraud. The model incorporates geographic and fraud alert data related to applicants and other consumers.\nManifest\nManifest allows customers to identify duplicate data sets in their data portfolios. Customers provide SentiLink with consumer personally identifiable information (PII), and SentiLink assigns each set of PII a unique ID. Customers send SentiLink consumer PII, such as consumer names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers (SSNs), addresses, phone numbers, and email. SentiLink compares the PII to the established unique IDs to identify matches.\nInsights\nThe Insights solution is a Know Your Customer (KYC) product designed to satisfy Customer Identification Program (CIP) obligations. Insights allow customers to uncover additional intelligence regarding PII and the risks associated with that PII, which facilitates investigation and remediation.\nDashboard\nThe Dashboard facilitates customer analysis of applicant information and SentiLink-licensed associated information to determine whether an applicant’s identity is legitimate. It allows customers to access SentiLink’s proprietary user interface to conduct further analysis and request further information regarding specific applications for fraud detection.\neCBSV\nAs part of the electronic Consent Based Social Security Number Verification (eCBSV) subscription, SentiLink submits eCBSV requests on behalf of permitted entities. eCBSV subscription services are provided via API or through a user interface.\nID Complete\nID Complete is designed to resolve missing or incomplete identity fields, such as dates of birth or SSNs, and suggest alternative information where applicable. Data suggestions are derived from customer data and SentiLink supplied data through SentiLink’s proprietary matching logic. The organization accepts data files from Experian.\nKYC Watchlist Checks\nThe KYC Watchlist Checks service allows customers to compare applicants to various government sanctions lists including, but not limited to, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs), United Nations Security Council, and the US Department of State watchlists.  SentiLink Corp.’s (SentiLink’s) technology helps its customers combat fraud, a crime in which fake identities are created and used to defraud financial institutions and government agencies. SentiLink equips users with the tools needed to visualize and prevent fraud in any domain, whether money laundering, contractor fraud, synthetic identities, first-party fraud, or classic third-party stolen identities. The organization offers the solutions below that help banks, lenders, credit unions, financial technology entities, insurance companies, and telecommunication companies prevent fraud.\n\n",

Data can be protected from exfiltration and damage by limiting which specific applications have access to it. \nThreatLocker's Configuration Manager allows organizations to set configuration policies such as password complexity requirements disabling unneeded network protocols across an organization or set of organizations from one central location without the need to use group policies or active directory. \nThreatLocker Detect uses the voluminous data in ThreatLocker logs and allows organizations to both alert themselves and respond automatically to anomalous events or suspicious behavior on their endpoints. In summary, the ThreatLocker zero-trust endpoint protection platform allows organizations to: \n• Block ransomware, viruses, malware, and rogue software from running. \n• Stop users from running unknown or unapproved software. \n• Stop lateral movement between applications and systems. \n• Stop trusted applications from being weaponized. \n• Control access to storage devices. \n• Audit and control data access by applications. \n• Quickly deploy and run an audit for the entire organization. \n• Update permissions quickly when requested and approved by IT. \n• Log and control all inbound network traffic. \n• Alert on and respond to defined anomalous events.\n",

ESC GovCloud can be deployed in line to analyze emails and quarantine threats for active protection, or as a passive monitor for 'bcc' type review of each email.\n\nWith no hardware or software to install, the ESC GovCloud is a particularly good fit for organizations seeking to move their infrastructure into the cloud. This eliminates the complexity of procuring, installing, and managing a physical infrastructure. ESC GovCloud provides organizations several unique capabilities, such as:\n\n- Identifying previous targets of spear-phishing, impersonation, virus and spam emails\n- Locating copies of the malicious email in target inboxes\n- Finding out if the message is being forwarded to new targets\n- Detection of advanced malicious URL threats\n- The ESC Portal shows region- and industry-based malware trends, has customizable security policies, RBAC, and audit logging.\n\nOrganizations face an ever-increasing number of threats from email-based spam, viruses, and advanced threats. ESC GovCloud uses the signature-less Trellix Multi-vector Virtual Execution™ (MVX) engine to analyze every attachment and URL within emails to detect threats and stop advanced attacks in real-time. Today's advanced attacks use email as a primary delivery mechanism for malicious content. While some attacks use an attachment with embedded malicious code, it is common for cybercriminals to use a malicious link thereby blending attack tactics in the hopes of bypassing today's traditional defense silos. ESC GovCloud uses the cloud-based MVX engine to detonate email attachments against a cross-matrix of operating systems and applications, including multiple Web browsers and plug-ins like Adobe Reader and Flash. To block spear-phishing emails, ESC GovCloud analyzes every attachment using the MVX engine to accurately identify today's advanced attacks.\n\nESC GovCloud includes anti-virus and anti-spam engines and may also be paired with an organization's existing anti-virus and anti-spam email gateways.",

    "cloud_service_provider": "VLogic Systems, Inc.",
    "cloud_service_offering": "VLogicFM",
    "service_description": "The VLogicFM® system is designed to provide users with real-time information about facilities that are managed within the system. \n\nSystem Function or Purpose\nThe VLogicFM system provides users with an overview of facilities usage as well as output data from sensors installed within the various facilities (e.g., motion, temperature, and humidity sensors). The VLogicFM system achieves this goal through the use of multiple modules that end-users can access via the VLogicFM Graphic User Interface (GUI). VLogicFM is composed of the following modules.\n\nAdministration Module\nThe Administration module provides a set of tools and utilities that allow administrators to manage user accounts and credentials, set up locations properties such as Sites, Buildings and Floors, and manage overall Access Control. Reports of background data and a Logbook of the activities in all modules by all users are also included in the Administration module. This module is accessible only by Administrators.\n\nAs-Builts Module\nThe VLogicFM As Built module provides a secure cloud-based repository of master as-builts CAD drawings, organized by site, building, floor and discipline. It facilitates sharing of drawings with professionals like engineers, construction managers, project managers etc. Stakeholders with access privileges can collaborate my notating ideas and comments right on the drawings for later discussion and decision-making. The As-Builts module also provides for drawings version control management, to keep track of all drawing iterations, and maintain an archive of all past versions.\n\nAssets Module\nThe VLogicFM Assets module provides a repository to store an inventory of facility assets. In addition, this module maps these assets to their location on facility floor plan drawings. This allows the user to not only list specific assets but also mark asset locations right on the CAD floor plan drawings—rapid identification of an asset AND its floor plan location simultaneously. The Assets module lets you add asset attributes, documentation, and attach asset pictures. Finally, you can also conduct asset audits using the companion VL Audit Android/iOS app for scanning asset and room bar/QR codes.\n\nCapital Asset Inventory (CAI) Module\nEach VA Medical Center is obligated to periodically submit a Capital Asset Inventory (CAI) report to its VISN office and ultimately to VA Central Office. Part of this VA report includes over 90 specific facility-related CAI space drivers that must be assigned to every space in the facility. The VLogicFM CAI module was custom-made specifically for the VA and includes all of these mandatory CAI space drivers. Users can assign these CAI space drivers to every space in the facility. This allows users to leverage VLogicFM to rapidly generate facility-related CAI reports for use in their periodic CAI submissions. What used to take weeks of manual effort can now be done in minutes.\n\nEmployee Module\nThe Employee Module manages assignments of employee lists to specific spaces on the CAD floor plan drawings by role/title or name. This module allows a facility to show how different organizations are stacked in the facility and also provides tools for moving employee room assignments across the facility.\n\nFire and Life Safety Module\nThe Fire and Life Safety Module facilitate organized documentation of the Fire Protection system linking riser diagrams, floor plan drawings and any other available documents. Connectivity information and other details required for maintenance of the system can be attached to the components and fixtures, which can be viewed in the context of the floor plan drawing. Datasheets, photographs, notes, etc. can be attached to any component of the system. Locating components like Fire Alarm Control Panel, Smoke Detector, Pressure Gauge, etc. can be done through simple search and report options.\n\nPlan Room Module\nThe Plan Room is a virtual library for storing digital facility drawings and related files. The module supports up to 70+ file formats. Customer administrators can set access permissions at the user level. Users can search the documents/drawings using keyword and advanced search options and download the documents for which they have access permissions.\n\nReal Property Module\nThe Real Property Module is intended for Tenants, Landlords and Brokers. It enables Facility Managers to keep track of their leased spaces and manage their leases effectively. This module lets users manage lease details such as Lease Type, Lease Property Type, Lease Category, Execution Date, Commencement Date, Expiry Date, Landlord/Tenant name, Lease Area and any other information that needs to be associated with the lease.\n\nScheduling Module\nThe Scheduling module is a robust room and desk booking/reservation system that enables everything from conference room reservations to hot desking bookings for hybrid work environments. Users can search for rooms they want to schedule by capacity, location, and even what amenities are provided in the room (AV equipment, white board, etc.). A check-in system is also deployed to mitigate against users overbooking spaces.\n\nSpace Module\nThe Space module is at the core of VLogicFM’s space management capabilities. The module pairs a powerful cloud-based MS SQL database with accurate CAD drawings, also stored on the same cloud repository. The combination of these two resources gives users the power to not only locate lists of rooms and room attributes, but also run distribution reports that colorize different rooms by Service Line / Department or other attributes. The Space module also provides the user with a range of reporting options to gauge trends, usable and chargeable areas and cost per square foot.\n\nTracking Module\nThe Tracking module uses IoT-based sensors installed in the facility to render objective occupancy data in real time. This module is currently used by VA users to assess occupancy trends for use cases such as space planning and load balancing / utilization of patient exam rooms between different service lines, clinics and sub-clinics.\n\nUtilities Module\nThe Utilities Module facilitates organized documentation of the Utilities Systems linking riser diagrams, floor plan drawings and any other available documents. Connectivity information and other details required for maintenance of the utility system can be linked to the components and fixtures. This allows users to display how parts of these systems are connected to one another in the context of the floor plan drawing. Data sheets, photographs, notes, etc. can be attached to any component of the system to facilitate easy maintenance. Locating components like Flow Control Valve, Smoke Detector, Pressure Gauge, etc. can be done through simple search. Users see lists of components next to these same components blinking on the CAD floor plan drawings.\n\nWork Order Module\nThe Work Order module can manage scheduled preventive maintenance activities as well as ad-hoc work request-based service activities. Work orders are generated based on previously defined PM schedules, or other service requests from users. Work orders contain information about a maintenance activity, such as where and how it is to be done, who is supposed to do it, and the supplies needed to complete the task. They keep track of the maintenance activities performed, time taken and cost information that is used to generate reports for planning and analysis.\n",

    "service_description": "WingSwept has provided case management solutions to investigators at government agencies for more than a decade. WingSwept converted its Case Management & Tracking System (CMTS) into a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) service offering in 2010. Built with both security and flexibility in mind, CMTS provides for the secure storage, retrieval, and reporting of case management data for investigative offices at all levels of government. The CMTS design is neither static nor monolithic. Intentionally flexible, CMTS provides government agencies with the ability to establish unique naming conventions, tailor agency-specific workflows, and to support a wide range of other user-preferred configurations. An idle-case tracking function also includes both time and activity-based notifications in order to establish and maintain a seamless agency workflow. \n\nAs an added layer of security, each CMTS customer operates in a secure environment with data separated by customer. Hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS), CMTS is a web-based, browser-accessible application that requires no device-specific software for implementation. Highly customizable dashboards, combined with specialized labels and entry fields provide investigators with the ability to compile and display comprehensive case metrics in a simplified, user-friendly format. CMTS can display ad-hoc and pre-defined reports in minutes, drastically reducing processing times and increasing staff efficiency. This flexible design allows agencies to tailor workflows in order to match existing processes and to provide for continuity in ongoing investigations. As a result, CMTS may be readily adapted to serve investigative offices of any size. Many of the CMTS customers leverage our optional Online Intake Service (OIS) which allows customers to host or leverage OIS hosted internet facing forms which can collect case intakes to be later securely picked up by the agency CMTS server for potential ingestion as a case.",

Wiz for Gov helps public sector agencies meet FedRAMP and FISMA compliance needs by focusing on the issues that matter most. The Wiz for Gov unified product line has three different components to secure your stack:\n\n\nWiz Cloud for Gov\n\nWiz Cloud focuses on assessing and prioritizing risk by analyzing vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, malware, identities, network paths, data, and AI risks. At its core is the Wiz Security Graph, which maps relationships between cloud resources to find \"toxic combinations\" that represent real risk. This approach automates risk assessments in alignment with OMB A-130's definition of risk as a function of the magnitude of harm and the likelihood of occurrence. It prioritizes these risks and routes them to relevant teams, providing a clear view of the attack path, blast radius, and recommended remediation steps.\n\n\nWiz Code for Gov\n\nWiz Code extends visibility into the development lifecycle to help enforce secure-by-design practices. By connecting directly to code repositories, Wiz provides full traceability from production issues back to the corresponding source code and owner. Wiz also integrates with CI/CD pipelines to enforce policies during image scanning and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) reviews, helping to identify risks earlier and accelerate time to production readiness. This shared view helps security and development teams collaborate, ensuring accountability and reducing mean time to remediation (MTTR).\n\n\nWiz Defend for Gov\n\nWiz Defend modernizes cloud threat detection and response by reducing alert fatigue and surfacing the root cause of issues faster. It leverages a cloud native runtime sensor, logs, and threat intelligence to identify malicious activity and enrich detected events with cloud context, providing SOC analysts with the information needed to assess threat impact and blast radius. This enhances active cyber defense across the full environment—including identity, workload runtime, network, data, and control plane components—and helps teams align response actions with the MITRE ATT&CK framework.",

Additionally, data can be exported through a user interface that necessitates authentication through an identity management system approved by each agency. Data is safeguarded by allowing IP addresses and firewalls to be listed at the network level, ensuring it is not accessible to individuals outside the agency's scope. The authorization boundary determines the realm of what is accessible in our platform.\n\nKey functionalities of the platform include:\n- In-place management of data, enabling the extraction of intelligence from documents without creating copies\n- Defensible deletion and cleanup of files\n- The capability to channel governed, relevant data into analytics and AI applications\n- Capture of records from a variety of electronic sources\n- Manual and automated classification of records\n- Global search, including sorting by relevance, for eDiscovery, investigations, and FOIA requests\n- Custom retention periods with time-, event-, and metadata-based triggers\n-Retention of records by agency-specific and General Retention Schedules\n- A complete audit log details all actions taken on documents for defensible records management and document deletion\n- A unified system for records management, compliance, eDiscovery, and FOIA requests, so that actions taken on documents are applied universally",
